## Description \*\*\*

Elite Media Design is a functional design
firm landing page. This is a application
to showcase a few of my skills to employers.
I am using SASS and UI Kit on the front end to
make components responsive and aestetic. The requirements
for the project ensured I use the relevant colors and
font family for the project.
